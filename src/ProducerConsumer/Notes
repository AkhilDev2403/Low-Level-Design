We had to/resolve the sync issue, bcz when xle threads accessing the same shared resource at the same time
we will get the max size beyond what we have given.
it is bcz xle threads coming and satisfies the if condition on both p and c class.

the sync issue occurs here
    a. critical section
    b. race condition
    c. pre-emptiness

    How to solve this ?
    ans -> add sync lock or block

Still we have some logic problem
The problem here is only one thread (producer/consumer) can enter at the same time
because what if i have 5 shelves/store size is available and there are 3 p's already produced.
Now 2 p's can produce and 3 cons can consume at the same time.

So we need to resolve this.

we need to let multiple threads to access the same shares resources at the same time.

How do we do this  ?  -> using Semaphores
